Session 2 developed the theoretical toolkit for understanding why financial systems are fragile: Minsky's endogenous cycle, information asymmetries, coordination failures, and amplification through leverage and collateral. This session turns from theory to mechanism. How, specifically, do financial crises translate into deep and prolonged recessions? Why are crisis-related recessions so much more severe than "normal" business cycle downturns? And what are the macroeconomic policy options when the standard toolkit, cutting interest rates, expanding government spending, proves insufficient?

The answers involve several distinct but interacting channels. Credit booms that precede crises leave behind overextended balance sheets that take years to repair. Capital flows that financed the boom reverse abruptly, especially in emerging markets. The banking system's distress feeds into the sovereign's fiscal position, and the sovereign's deteriorating creditworthiness feeds back into the banking system. Monetary policy runs into the zero lower bound, and fiscal policy runs into the constraints of rising public debt. These mechanisms do not operate independently; they interact in ways that can produce prolonged stagnation or, in the worst cases, deflationary spirals.

This session provides the macroeconomic framework for the historical case studies that follow in Parts II through IV. The mechanisms described here will recur in nearly every crisis episode we examine.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

1. Describe the empirical regularities of credit booms and their aftermath, including the evidence from the Jordà-Schularick-Taylor dataset that credit-intensive expansions are followed by deeper recessions and slower recoveries.
2. Explain Koo's balance sheet recession framework, including the paradox of thrift at the aggregate level and the implications for monetary and fiscal policy effectiveness.
3. Analyze the mechanics of sudden stops and capital flow reversals in emerging markets, using Calvo's framework, and explain why current account reversals are associated with severe output losses.
4. Describe the sovereign-bank doom loop, including the channels through which banking crises become sovereign debt crises and vice versa, and explain why this feedback loop is especially dangerous in monetary unions.
5. Explain why conventional monetary policy becomes ineffective at the zero lower bound and evaluate the theoretical rationale and empirical evidence for unconventional monetary policies (quantitative easing, forward guidance, negative interest rates).
6. Assess the role of fiscal policy in financial crises, including the debate over fiscal multipliers in recessions, the austerity controversy, and the constraints imposed by sovereign debt sustainability.

## Session Outline

This session is divided into the following subsections:

**3.1 Credit Booms and Their Aftermath.** The empirical evidence on how credit booms shape the business cycle. Evidence from the Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database showing that credit-intensive expansions are followed by deeper recessions and slower recoveries. The distinction between "normal" recessions and "financial" recessions.

**3.2 Balance Sheet Recessions.** Richard Koo's framework for understanding prolonged post-crisis stagnation. When the private sector shifts from profit maximization to debt minimization, conventional monetary policy becomes ineffective and fiscal policy becomes essential. Japan's Lost Decade as the canonical case.

**3.3 Sudden Stops and Capital Flow Reversals.** The macroeconomics of capital account crises in emerging markets. Calvo's sudden stop framework, the role of currency mismatches and original sin, and why capital flow reversals produce such severe output contractions.

**3.4 The Sovereign-Bank Nexus.** The feedback loop between banking crises and sovereign debt crises. How banking bailouts create fiscal burdens, how sovereign distress destabilizes banks, and why monetary unions are especially vulnerable. The European debt crisis as illustration.

**3.5 Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound.** The liquidity trap problem and the limits of conventional monetary easing. Unconventional monetary policy tools: quantitative easing, forward guidance, yield curve control, and negative interest rates. Evidence on their effectiveness.

**3.6 Fiscal Policy in Crises.** The case for fiscal stimulus during financial crises. Fiscal multipliers in recessions versus expansions. The austerity debate: evidence from the European experience. Constraints from sovereign debt sustainability and the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy.
