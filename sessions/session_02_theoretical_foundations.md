Session 1 established what crises are, how often they occur, and how costly they can be. It also introduced the Minsky-Kindleberger narrative of boom and bust as a descriptive template. But description is not explanation. To understand why financial systems periodically break down, and why certain institutional arrangements are more fragile than others, we need theory.

This session surveys the major theoretical frameworks that economists have developed to explain financial instability. The theories span more than a century, from Walter Bagehot's analysis of the money market in the 1870s to the network models of contagion developed in the 2010s. They differ in many respects: some emphasize rational behavior under imperfect information, others emphasize bounded rationality or behavioral biases; some focus on individual institutions, others on the system as a whole; some generate crises endogenously, others require exogenous shocks to set things in motion.

Despite these differences, the theories share a common recognition that financial systems are inherently fragile. The maturity transformation that makes banking useful also makes it vulnerable. The leverage that amplifies returns in good times amplifies losses in bad times. The interconnections that allow risk to be shared also allow shocks to propagate. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for everything that follows in the course: the historical case studies, the policy analysis, and the empirical work on early warning indicators.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

1. Trace the development of crisis theory from Bagehot and Fisher through Minsky to modern formal models, and explain what each generation of theory added to our understanding.
2. State Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis formally, including the three financing regimes and the endogenous transition mechanism, and evaluate its strengths and limitations.
3. Explain how information asymmetries (adverse selection, moral hazard) generate credit rationing and amplify financial fragility, using the frameworks of Akerlof, Stiglitz-Weiss, and related work.
4. Derive the logic of the Diamond-Dybvig bank run model and explain why demand deposits create a coordination problem with multiple equilibria.
5. Describe the financial accelerator mechanism (Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist) and the Kiyotaki-Moore credit cycle model, and explain how they generate amplification and persistence of shocks.
6. Compare the rational bubble theory with behavioral explanations of asset price booms, and explain the empirical challenges of distinguishing between them.

## Session Outline

This session is divided into the following subsections:

**2.1 Classical Foundations: From Bagehot to Fisher.** The intellectual origins of crisis theory. Bagehot on the lender of last resort, Wicksell on the cumulative process, and Fisher's debt-deflation theory. These 19th and early 20th century contributions identified many of the mechanisms that modern theory has formalized.

**2.2 Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis.** The most influential heterodox theory of financial crises. We present the hypothesis in detail: the three financing regimes (hedge, speculative, Ponzi), the endogenous transition from stability to fragility, and the role of institutional evolution. We also discuss the main criticisms of the Minskyan framework.

**2.3 Information Asymmetries and Financial Fragility.** How adverse selection and moral hazard create market failures in credit markets. The Akerlof lemons problem applied to financial markets, Stiglitz-Weiss credit rationing, and the implications for financial fragility and crisis propagation.

**2.4 Bank Runs and Contagion.** The Diamond-Dybvig model of bank runs as a coordination failure with multiple equilibria. Extensions to interbank contagion, network models, and the role of deposit insurance and lender-of-last-resort facilities.

**2.5 The Financial Accelerator and Credit Cycles.** How small shocks get amplified into large fluctuations through credit market frictions. The Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist financial accelerator, the Kiyotaki-Moore model of credit cycles, and the broader literature on leverage cycles.

**2.6 Rational Bubbles and Irrational Exuberance.** Can asset price bubbles be consistent with rational behavior? The theory of rational bubbles, the efficient markets critique, and behavioral finance alternatives. Why the bubble question matters for crisis prevention policy.
