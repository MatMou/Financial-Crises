title: "2.3 Information Asymmetries and Financial Fragility"
subtitle: Adverse selection, moral hazard, and credit rationing
---

Minsky's FIH explains financial fragility in terms of the endogenous evolution of financing structures, but it does so largely without formal models of individual behavior. Beginning in the 1970s and 1980s, a parallel line of research approached the same problem from a different direction: the economics of information. This literature showed that the standard assumptions of perfect information and complete markets, which underpin the Arrow-Debreu model and the Modigliani-Miller theorem, break down in ways that are especially consequential for financial markets. When borrowers know more about their own riskiness than lenders do, and when borrowers can take actions after receiving a loan that affect the probability of repayment, the market for credit does not behave like the market for apples. Prices do not necessarily clear the market, the quantity of credit supplied does not necessarily equal the quantity demanded, and small changes in information or expectations can produce large and discontinuous changes in market outcomes.

This subsection surveys three foundational contributions: Akerlof's analysis of adverse selection, Stiglitz and Weiss's theory of credit rationing, and the broader literature on moral hazard in financial intermediation. Together, these contributions provide the microeconomic foundations for understanding why financial markets are prone to sudden collapses, why credit can dry up abruptly even when fundamentals have not changed dramatically, and why government intervention (deposit insurance, lender of last resort, prudential regulation) may be necessary to maintain financial stability.

## The lemons problem in financial markets

George Akerlof's "The Market for Lemons" (1970) demonstrated that asymmetric information, a situation in which one party to a transaction knows more than the other, can cause markets to function poorly or even to collapse entirely ({cite:t}`Akerlof1970`).

Akerlof's original example concerned the used car market. Sellers of used cars know whether their car is good or a "lemon," but buyers cannot tell the difference before purchase. Because buyers know that some fraction of the cars on the market are lemons, they are only willing to pay a price that reflects the average quality of cars offered. But this average price is too low for owners of good cars, who withdraw from the market. As good cars disappear, the average quality of remaining cars falls, which further reduces the price buyers are willing to pay, which drives out more good cars. In the extreme case, the market unravels entirely: only lemons are traded, or the market ceases to exist.

The application to financial markets is direct and powerful. Consider the market for corporate bonds or bank loans. Borrowers know more about their own financial condition, the riskiness of their investment projects, and their likelihood of repayment than lenders do. If lenders cannot distinguish between safe and risky borrowers, they charge an interest rate that reflects the average default risk of the pool. But this average rate is too high for safe borrowers, who are effectively subsidizing risky borrowers. Some safe borrowers drop out of the market (they forgo investment or finance internally), leaving a pool of borrowers that is riskier on average. The interest rate rises to reflect the higher average risk, which drives out more safe borrowers, and so on.

This adverse selection mechanism has several important implications for financial stability.

First, the quality of the borrower pool deteriorates precisely when credit conditions tighten. During recessions, when the average riskiness of borrowers increases, the adverse selection problem becomes more severe. Lenders respond by raising interest rates or tightening non-price terms, which drives safe borrowers out of the market, which makes the problem worse. This amplification mechanism can turn a moderate tightening of credit conditions into a sharp contraction.

Second, adverse selection can cause credit markets to freeze suddenly. Unlike goods markets, where prices adjust smoothly to changes in supply and demand, credit markets can exhibit discontinuities. A small deterioration in the information environment (for example, the revelation that a previously trusted class of securities contains hidden risks) can cause lenders to withdraw from the market entirely, because they can no longer distinguish between good and bad borrowers. The "sudden stop" in interbank lending that occurred in August 2007, when banks stopped lending to each other because they could not assess their counterparties' exposure to subprime mortgage losses, is a canonical example.

Third, adverse selection provides a rationale for institutions that exist to mitigate information problems. Banks, in this framework, exist because they specialize in screening and monitoring borrowers, reducing the information gap that plagues anonymous credit markets. Credit rating agencies exist to provide standardized assessments of borrower quality. Collateral requirements exist to align the interests of borrowers and lenders by giving borrowers something to lose. The collapse of any of these information-processing mechanisms, whether through bank failures, the discrediting of rating agencies (as occurred in the subprime crisis), or the evaporation of collateral values, can trigger a reversion to the lemons equilibrium.

## Stiglitz-Weiss credit rationing

Joseph Stiglitz and Andrew Weiss, in their landmark 1981 paper "Credit Rationing in Markets with Imperfect Information," demonstrated a result that was startling to economists trained in the competitive equilibrium tradition: in equilibrium, the interest rate charged on loans may not clear the credit market ({cite:t}`StiglitzWeiss1981`). There may be borrowers who are willing to pay the prevailing rate and who appear creditworthy, but who are unable to obtain loans. Credit is rationed, and the rationing is not a temporary disequilibrium that will be corrected by market forces; it is a stable, equilibrium outcome.

The logic of the Stiglitz-Weiss result rests on two effects that higher interest rates have on the quality of the bank's loan portfolio.

The first is the **adverse selection effect**. When the bank raises its interest rate, the safest borrowers (those with low-risk projects and the most alternative funding options) drop out of the applicant pool. The remaining applicants are, on average, riskier. Higher interest rates therefore worsen the quality of the bank's loan portfolio, even though they increase the revenue per loan.

The second is the **moral hazard effect** (which we discuss more fully below). When the interest rate rises, borrowers who do receive loans have an incentive to choose riskier projects. The logic is straightforward: the borrower bears the downside risk (default) regardless of the interest rate, but the higher interest rate reduces the payoff in the good state. The borrower can partially offset this by switching to a riskier project with a higher payoff in the good state, even though the project has a higher probability of failure. Higher interest rates thus induce borrowers to take more risk, further worsening the quality of the bank's portfolio.

These two effects mean that the bank's expected return on lending is not a monotonically increasing function of the interest rate. At low rates, an increase in the rate raises the bank's expected return because the revenue effect dominates. But beyond some point, the adverse selection and moral hazard effects dominate, and further increases in the rate actually reduce the bank's expected return. The bank's expected return is maximized at an interior interest rate, which Stiglitz and Weiss called the "bank-optimal" rate.

If the demand for credit at the bank-optimal rate exceeds the supply, the bank does not raise the rate to clear the market, because doing so would reduce its expected return. Instead, the bank rations credit: it lends at the bank-optimal rate to as many borrowers as it can serve and turns away the rest. The rejected borrowers are not necessarily riskier than the approved borrowers; they are simply unlucky in the rationing process.

The implications for financial stability are profound. Credit rationing means that the supply of credit can change discontinuously in response to changes in the economic environment. A moderate deterioration in borrower quality, or a moderate increase in uncertainty about borrower quality, can cause a discrete reduction in the amount of credit available. This is because the bank-optimal interest rate shifts in response to changes in the distribution of borrower risk, and the gap between credit demanded and credit supplied can open or close abruptly. The result is that credit supply can exhibit the kind of sudden contractions, "credit crunches," that are frequently observed during financial crises but that are difficult to explain in models without information problems.

Credit rationing also means that monetary policy operates through channels other than the interest rate. Even if the central bank lowers the policy rate, banks may not expand credit if they perceive that the quality of the borrower pool has deteriorated. This is the "pushing on a string" problem that policymakers encountered during the Great Depression and again during the 2007-2009 crisis: conventional monetary easing may be ineffective when the fundamental constraint on credit is information, not the cost of funds.

## Moral hazard in financial intermediation

Moral hazard arises when one party to a contract can take actions, after the contract is signed, that affect the payoff to the other party, and the other party cannot observe or control those actions. In financial markets, moral hazard is pervasive and takes several forms.

**Borrower moral hazard** is the classic case analyzed by Stiglitz and Weiss. After receiving a loan, the borrower may choose a riskier investment strategy than the one that was agreed upon, because the borrower captures the upside while the lender bears much of the downside (through default). The borrower may also exert less effort to make the project succeed, or may divert funds to personal consumption, knowing that the lender cannot perfectly monitor the use of the funds.

**Equity holder moral hazard** arises in firms financed by a mix of debt and equity. Because equity holders have limited liability, they benefit from risky strategies that pay off but are protected from the worst outcomes if the strategy fails (the losses fall on creditors). This "gambling for resurrection" incentive is especially strong when the firm is close to insolvency: the equity holders have little to lose and everything to gain from taking large risks. In the context of financial institutions, this incentive can lead banks to increase their risk exposure precisely when they are weakest, which amplifies financial fragility.

**Managerial moral hazard** is a further layer. The managers of financial institutions may have incentives that diverge from those of the institution's shareholders, creditors, or depositors. Compensation structures that reward short-term profitability (such as annual bonuses tied to trading revenue) encourage risk-taking that may be detrimental to long-term stability. The pre-crisis compensation practices at large financial institutions, where traders and executives earned enormous bonuses during the boom and bore no personal losses during the bust, are a textbook example.

**Moral hazard from the safety net** is perhaps the most important form for financial stability. When depositors are protected by deposit insurance, they have little incentive to monitor the riskiness of their bank's activities. When banks expect to be rescued by the government if they fail ("too big to fail"), they have an incentive to take more risk than they would if they expected to bear the full consequences of failure. The safety net that exists to prevent panics can, paradoxically, encourage the risk-taking that makes panics more likely. This tension between the stabilizing benefits and the moral hazard costs of government guarantees is one of the central dilemmas of financial regulation and will recur throughout the course.

The moral hazard problem is especially severe in financial intermediation because of the nature of banking. Banks are inherently opaque: their assets (loans) are difficult to value from outside, their liabilities (deposits) are withdrawable on demand, and their capital (the buffer between assets and liabilities) is typically thin relative to the size of their balance sheet. This opacity means that depositors, creditors, and regulators all face significant information disadvantages relative to the bank's management, creating ample scope for moral hazard.

## From information problems to systemic fragility

The adverse selection and moral hazard problems described above create fragility at the level of individual financial relationships. But the aggregation of these individual-level problems can produce systemic fragility, where the financial system as a whole becomes vulnerable to disruptions that go far beyond what would be expected from any single information failure.

The mechanism works through what Frederic Mishkin has called the **asymmetric information view of financial crises** ({cite:t}`Mishkin1991`). In this framework, a financial crisis is fundamentally an event in which the ability of financial markets to channel funds from savers to productive investors breaks down because of a severe worsening of asymmetric information problems.

The worsening can be triggered by several types of events. An increase in interest rates (whether driven by monetary policy or by market forces) exacerbates adverse selection and moral hazard through the Stiglitz-Weiss mechanism. A decline in the stock market reduces the net worth of borrowing firms, which reduces the collateral available to back loans and increases the severity of the moral hazard problem (because firms with less net worth have less to lose from risky behavior). An increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook makes it harder for lenders to distinguish between good and bad borrowers, exacerbating adverse selection. A bank panic, by destroying the information capital that banks have accumulated through their lending relationships, can cause a catastrophic deterioration in the information environment.

Any of these events, or a combination of them, can push the financial system from a state in which information problems are manageable (and credit flows reasonably well) to a state in which information problems are so severe that credit markets freeze. The transition can be abrupt, because the information problems are subject to positive feedback: a worsening of information problems causes credit to contract, which causes economic conditions to deteriorate, which causes information problems to worsen further.

This framework has been applied to numerous historical episodes. Bernanke (1983) used it to explain why the Great Depression was so severe: the collapse of the banking system destroyed the information capital embodied in bank-borrower relationships, causing a catastrophic contraction of credit that far exceeded what could be explained by the decline in the money supply alone ({cite:t}`Bernanke1983`). Mishkin (1991) applied it to a wide range of financial crises, showing that the pattern of rising interest rates, declining asset prices, increased uncertainty, and bank panics is a recurring feature. The framework also provides a clear rationale for policy interventions such as deposit insurance (which prevents information-destroying bank panics), lender-of-last-resort facilities (which prevent liquidity problems from becoming solvency problems), and prudential regulation (which limits the risk-taking that moral hazard encourages).

## The information perspective and the Minsky perspective

The information-based theories discussed in this subsection and the Minsky-based theory discussed in subsection 2.2 approach financial fragility from different directions, but they are more complementary than competing.

Minsky emphasizes the endogenous evolution of financial structures over the cycle: stability breeds overconfidence, which breeds fragility. The information literature emphasizes the specific mechanisms through which fragility manifests: adverse selection causes credit markets to freeze, moral hazard causes risk-taking to escalate, and the collapse of information-processing institutions (banks, rating agencies) can trigger systemic disruptions.

The two perspectives reinforce each other. The Minsky cycle provides the dynamic framework: during booms, information problems are masked by rising asset prices and low default rates, and the financial system drifts toward fragility. The information perspective provides the mechanism through which the Minsky moment unfolds: when confidence turns, the information problems that were manageable during the boom become overwhelming, and credit markets seize up.

Subsection 2.4 takes the information perspective further by examining the specific problem of bank runs and contagion, where coordination failures among depositors and interconnections among institutions can produce systemic collapse even when the underlying economic fundamentals do not justify it.
