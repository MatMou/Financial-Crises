title: "3.6 Fiscal Policy in Crises"
subtitle: Stimulus, austerity, and the multiplier debate
---

When monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound and the private sector is deleveraging, fiscal policy becomes the primary remaining tool for supporting aggregate demand. This is a straightforward implication of basic macroeconomic accounting: if the private sector shifts from deficit to surplus and the central bank cannot reduce interest rates further, someone must fill the demand gap, and that someone is the government. Yet fiscal policy during and after financial crises has been the subject of intense controversy, particularly around the questions of how large fiscal multipliers are, whether austerity during a recession is self-defeating, and how to balance the immediate need for stimulus against the long-run constraint of sovereign debt sustainability.

## Automatic stabilizers

Before considering discretionary fiscal policy, it is important to recognize the role of **automatic stabilizers**: features of the tax and transfer system that automatically cushion the impact of a recession on household income and aggregate demand.

The most important automatic stabilizers are the progressive income tax (which reduces tax collections automatically when incomes fall), unemployment insurance (which provides income to workers who lose their jobs), and other means-tested transfer programs (which expand as more households fall below income thresholds). In most advanced economies, automatic stabilizers offset approximately 30-50% of a decline in GDP, meaning that a 5% decline in GDP produces only a 2.5-3.5% decline in disposable income.

Automatic stabilizers have two advantages over discretionary policy. First, they act immediately and without the legislative delays that typically accompany discretionary fiscal measures. Second, they are temporary by design: as the economy recovers, tax collections rise and transfer payments fall automatically, reversing the fiscal expansion.

During the global financial crisis, automatic stabilizers provided substantial support in countries with large welfare states (notably the Nordic countries, Germany, and France). They were less effective in countries with smaller welfare states (notably the United States, where unemployment insurance coverage was limited and the safety net was thinner). The unevenness of automatic stabilizers across countries contributed to the uneven performance of different economies during the crisis.

## Discretionary fiscal stimulus

When a recession is sufficiently severe, automatic stabilizers alone are insufficient, and governments turn to **discretionary fiscal stimulus**: deliberate increases in government spending or reductions in taxes beyond what automatic stabilizers provide.

The theoretical case for fiscal stimulus during a financial crisis rests on the argument that the fiscal multiplier (the increase in GDP per dollar of government spending) is significantly larger during recessions than during normal times. The standard critique of fiscal stimulus, that government spending "crowds out" private spending by raising interest rates, does not apply when the economy is at the zero lower bound. When the central bank is holding interest rates at zero and plans to continue doing so regardless of what happens to the deficit, there is no crowding out: government borrowing does not raise interest rates because the central bank is suppressing rates across the yield curve. In this environment, the fiscal multiplier can be substantially above one, meaning that a dollar of government spending increases GDP by more than a dollar, because the initial spending generates income that is partly re-spent, generating further rounds of income and spending.

{cite:t}`BlanchardLeigh2013` provided influential evidence on this point by examining the relationship between fiscal consolidation forecasts and subsequent growth forecast errors during the European crisis. They found that countries that implemented larger fiscal consolidations experienced larger negative growth surprises, implying that the fiscal multipliers used in the forecasting models (which were calibrated on normal-times data) were too low. Their estimates implied that the actual multiplier during the European crisis was approximately 1.5, compared to the 0.5 assumed in the forecasts. This "multiplier underestimation" meant that the austerity programs implemented in the Eurozone periphery had much larger contractionary effects than policymakers anticipated.

The composition of fiscal stimulus matters. The evidence suggests that government spending on goods and services (public investment, infrastructure, maintenance of public services) has larger multiplier effects than tax cuts, particularly tax cuts targeted at high-income households who have a lower marginal propensity to consume. Transfers to liquidity-constrained households (direct payments, expanded unemployment benefits, food assistance) also have large multiplier effects because the recipients spend most or all of the transfer. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, the largest discretionary fiscal stimulus in U.S. history at the time, included approximately $288 billion in tax cuts and $499 billion in spending increases. Estimates of its impact suggest that it raised GDP by 1.5-3.5% at its peak effect and supported 1-3 million jobs, though the estimates vary widely depending on the methodology used.

## The austerity debate

The most heated fiscal policy debate of the post-crisis period concerned the appropriateness of **austerity**, meaning fiscal consolidation (spending cuts and/or tax increases) during or immediately after a recession. The debate was concentrated in Europe, where several countries implemented large fiscal consolidations beginning in 2010, partly in response to pressure from financial markets (which demanded fiscal discipline as a condition for continued lending) and partly in response to conditions imposed by the EU, the ECB, and the IMF as part of bailout programs.

The case for austerity rested on several arguments. Rising public debt-to-GDP ratios, which had increased sharply as a result of the banking crisis and the recession, were seen as unsustainable and as a potential trigger for a sovereign debt crisis. {cite:t}`ReinhartRogoff2010` published a widely cited paper arguing that public debt above 90% of GDP was associated with significantly lower economic growth, which was interpreted (controversially) as evidence that high debt causes low growth and that fiscal consolidation was therefore growth-enhancing. The "confidence fairy" argument held that credible fiscal consolidation would boost confidence among consumers, firms, and investors, offsetting the contractionary effects of spending cuts and tax increases.

The case against austerity rested on the arguments developed above: that fiscal multipliers are large during recessions, that fiscal consolidation during a downturn is self-defeating (because the contractionary effects reduce GDP, which reduces tax revenue, which may actually increase the debt-to-GDP ratio), and that the priority should be supporting the recovery rather than reducing the deficit. The Reinhart-Rogoff paper was subsequently found to contain a coding error that significantly affected the results, and the broader empirical relationship between debt and growth was shown to be much weaker and less causal than initially claimed.

The European experience provided a tragic natural experiment. Countries that implemented the largest fiscal consolidations (Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland) experienced the deepest recessions, the highest unemployment rates, and the slowest recoveries. Greece, which implemented the most severe austerity program, saw its GDP decline by approximately 25% between 2008 and 2013, unemployment rise to 27%, and its public debt-to-GDP ratio actually *increase* (from approximately 120% to 175%) despite the austerity, because the denominator (GDP) was shrinking faster than the numerator (debt). This outcome was precisely what the anti-austerity argument had predicted: fiscal consolidation during a severe recession is self-defeating because the contractionary effects dominate.

The lesson from the austerity debate is not that fiscal consolidation is never appropriate, but that the timing matters enormously. Fiscal consolidation during a deep recession, when the economy is at or near the zero lower bound and the private sector is deleveraging, produces much larger contractionary effects than fiscal consolidation during a normal expansion. The appropriate strategy, as argued by many economists during the crisis, is to combine short-term stimulus (to support the recovery) with credible medium-term consolidation plans (to reassure markets about long-run fiscal sustainability).

## Sovereign debt sustainability and fiscal space

The constraint on fiscal policy during crises is sovereign debt sustainability. A government that borrows to finance stimulus must eventually repay the debt (or at least stabilize it relative to GDP), and the market's willingness to lend depends on its assessment of the government's ability and willingness to do so.

The standard framework for assessing debt sustainability is the **government budget constraint**, which says that the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio depends on the primary fiscal balance (the fiscal balance excluding interest payments), the interest rate on the debt, and the growth rate of GDP. When the interest rate exceeds the growth rate ($r > g$), the government must run a primary surplus to stabilize the debt ratio. When the growth rate exceeds the interest rate ($g > r$), the government can run a primary deficit and still see the debt ratio decline, because the denominator (GDP) is growing faster than the interest cost of the debt.

The relationship between interest rates and growth rates has important implications for the fiscal policy debate. In the period after the global financial crisis, interest rates on government debt in most advanced economies fell well below growth rates, creating an environment in which debt sustainability was less of a constraint than it had been in the past. Olivier Blanchard, in his 2019 AEA presidential address, argued that when $r < g$, the fiscal cost of debt is much lower than commonly assumed, and that fiscal policy should be more actively used to stabilize the economy and finance public investment ({cite:t}`Blanchard2019`).

This argument does not imply that debt can grow without limit. Even when $r < g$, there is an upper bound on the debt-to-GDP ratio that a government can sustain, and that bound depends on the country's institutional credibility, its track record of fiscal discipline, the currency in which its debt is denominated, and the structure of its economy. Countries with weaker institutions, a history of default, or debt denominated in foreign currency face tighter constraints. Countries with strong institutions, independent central banks, and debt denominated in their own currency (such as the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom) have more "fiscal space," meaning they can sustain higher levels of debt without triggering a fiscal crisis.

The concept of fiscal space is crucial for crisis management. Countries that enter a financial crisis with low public debt and strong fiscal institutions have room to implement large fiscal stimulus programs without triggering a sovereign debt crisis. Countries that enter with high public debt or weak fiscal credibility may find that attempts to stimulate the economy are constrained by market concerns about debt sustainability, which raise borrowing costs and offset the expansionary effects of the stimulus. This asymmetry is one of the strongest arguments for fiscal discipline during normal times: maintaining low public debt during expansions preserves the fiscal space needed to respond aggressively to crises.
