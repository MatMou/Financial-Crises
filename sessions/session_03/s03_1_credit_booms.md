subtitle: What the long-run data tell us about credit and recessions
---

Session 1 established that credit booms precede crises (Stylized Fact 4), and Session 2 provided theoretical explanations for why credit amplifies fluctuations (the financial accelerator, the leverage cycle). This subsection presents the empirical evidence in more detail, drawing primarily on the Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database, which provides the most comprehensive long-run data on the relationship between credit growth and the business cycle.

The central finding is stark: not all recessions are alike. Recessions that follow credit booms, which the literature calls "financial recessions," are systematically deeper, longer, and more damaging than recessions that are not preceded by rapid credit growth. This distinction between financial and normal recessions is one of the most important empirical results in modern macroeconomics, and it has profound implications for both crisis prevention and crisis management.

## The Jordà-Schularick-Taylor Macrohistory Database

The Jordà-Schularick-Taylor (JST) Macrohistory Database covers 18 advanced economies from 1870 to the present, providing annual data on real GDP, credit to the private non-financial sector, money aggregates, interest rates, asset prices (equities and housing), public finances, and external accounts. The database was assembled by Òscar Jordà, Moritz Schularick, and Alan Taylor through a painstaking process of harmonizing historical national accounts and financial statistics across countries and time periods ({cite:t}`JordaSchularickTaylor2017`).

The breadth of the dataset is its great strength. It covers two world wars, the Great Depression, the Bretton Woods era, the Great Moderation, and the global financial crisis, all within a consistent framework. This allows researchers to identify patterns that are robust across very different institutional environments and policy regimes.

The key variable in the JST analysis is the ratio of bank credit to the private non-financial sector divided by GDP: the credit-to-GDP ratio. The growth rate of this ratio, and its deviation from trend (the credit-to-GDP gap discussed in subsection 1.5), are the primary measures of credit boom intensity. The JST dataset confirms the finding of {cite:t}`SchularickTaylor2012` that credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises: a one-standard-deviation increase in the rate of credit growth during an expansion roughly doubles the probability that the subsequent downturn will involve a systemic banking crisis.

## Financial recessions versus normal recessions

The central empirical contribution of the JST research program is the comparison between recessions that follow credit booms ("financial recessions") and recessions that do not ("normal recessions"). The methodology uses local projections (Jordà 2005), which trace out the dynamic response of macroeconomic variables to the onset of a recession, conditioning on the amount of credit growth that occurred during the preceding expansion.

The results, documented across several papers by Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor, can be summarized in five empirical regularities.

First, **financial recessions are deeper**. The peak-to-trough decline in real GDP is substantially larger in recessions that follow credit-intensive expansions. Across the full JST sample, the average peak-to-trough decline in a normal recession is approximately 2-3% of GDP, whereas in a financial recession the decline is approximately 5-6%, roughly double. The difference is statistically significant and robust to controlling for a wide range of other variables.

Second, **financial recessions last longer**. The time from peak to recovery (defined as the point at which GDP returns to its pre-recession level) is substantially longer after financial recessions. Normal recessions typically see GDP recover within 2-3 years. Financial recessions often take 4-6 years, and in some cases (Japan after 1991, Greece after 2008) the economy has not fully recovered even after a decade.

Third, **the severity depends on the size of the preceding credit boom**. This is not a binary distinction (financial vs. normal); it is a continuous relationship. Recessions preceded by larger credit booms are associated with deeper declines and slower recoveries, in a roughly proportional manner. The "excess credit" accumulated during the boom, defined as credit growth above trend, is a strong predictor of the severity of the subsequent recession.

Fourth, **financial recessions are associated with larger declines in investment and larger increases in unemployment**. Investment (both residential and business) contracts sharply during financial recessions because the amplification mechanisms described in Session 2 (falling collateral values, rising risk premia, credit rationing) hit the investment sector especially hard. Unemployment rises more and stays elevated for longer, reflecting both the deeper output decline and the structural adjustments (sectoral reallocation, skill mismatch) that financial crises often require.

Fifth, **financial recessions are associated with significant fiscal deterioration**. Tax revenues fall as output declines, transfer payments (unemployment insurance, social assistance) rise, and governments often incur direct costs from banking sector rescues. The result is a sharp increase in public debt, which constrains the fiscal policy response and can trigger a sovereign debt crisis (discussed in subsection 3.4).

## The credit boom as a predictive indicator

The JST findings have important implications for crisis prediction and prevention. If the size of the credit boom during an expansion predicts the severity of the subsequent recession, then monitoring credit growth in real time can provide early warning of building vulnerabilities.

This is precisely the logic behind the BIS credit-to-GDP gap discussed in subsection 1.5. The gap measures the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-run trend. When the gap is positive and large (above 10 percentage points), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recommends that national authorities consider activating the countercyclical capital buffer, which requires banks to hold additional capital during booms that can be released during downturns.

The predictive power of the credit-to-GDP gap is impressive in historical backtesting. {cite:t}`Drehmann2014` show that the gap would have signaled elevated risk in most of the major financial crises of the past 40 years, including the Nordic crises of the early 1990s, the Asian crisis of 1997, and the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. The U.S. credit-to-GDP gap reached approximately 12 percentage points in 2007, well above the 10 percentage point threshold.

However, the indicator is far from perfect. It generates false positives (periods when the gap is elevated but no crisis follows) as well as false negatives (crises that occur without a preceding large gap). The gap is also slow to signal risk because it is based on a long-run trend that updates gradually. And it focuses on a single dimension of risk (aggregate credit growth) while ignoring other dimensions (the composition of credit, the structure of the financial system, cross-border exposures) that may be equally important. We return to the design of early warning systems in Session 16.

## Why credit booms matter: mechanisms

The correlation between credit booms and severe recessions is well established. But correlation is not causation, and understanding the mechanisms through which credit booms produce deep recessions is essential for designing appropriate policy responses.

Several mechanisms have been proposed, and the evidence suggests that all of them contribute.

The **balance sheet mechanism** is the most direct. During a credit boom, firms and households accumulate debt. When the boom ends and asset prices decline, the debt remains (it is fixed in nominal terms) while the value of the assets that collateralize the debt falls. The resulting deterioration in balance sheets, the increase in leverage and the decline in net worth, triggers the financial accelerator and the Kiyotaki-Moore dynamics described in subsection 2.5. Investment and consumption contract as borrowers cut spending to service and repay their debt. This mechanism is especially powerful when the credit boom is concentrated in real estate, because housing is the dominant asset on household balance sheets and because housing wealth has strong effects on consumer spending.

The **misallocation mechanism** operates during the boom itself. When credit is abundant and cheap, resources are directed toward projects and sectors that would not be profitable at normal interest rates. The most obvious example is the construction sector, which expands dramatically during housing booms and contracts sharply when the boom ends. The workers and capital that were employed in construction during the boom must be reallocated to other sectors, a process that takes time and generates structural unemployment. {cite:t}`Gopinath2017` provide evidence that credit booms in the Eurozone periphery before the crisis were associated with a misallocation of capital toward less productive firms, which reduced aggregate productivity growth and made the subsequent adjustment more painful.

The **banking sector mechanism** operates through the supply side of credit. When a credit boom ends and borrowers default, banks suffer losses that erode their capital. Undercapitalized banks reduce lending, either because they are constrained by regulatory capital requirements or because they become more risk-averse. The resulting credit contraction reduces investment and consumption, deepening the recession. This mechanism can create a self-reinforcing cycle: the recession causes more defaults, which further erode bank capital, which further reduces lending, and so on. Breaking this cycle typically requires recapitalization of the banking system, which is the most expensive component of crisis resolution.

The **expectations mechanism** operates through confidence and uncertainty. The bursting of a credit boom is often accompanied by a sharp increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook, the health of the financial system, and the policy response. This uncertainty causes firms and households to postpone investment and consumption decisions, further depressing economic activity. The increase in uncertainty is partly rational (the future genuinely is more uncertain after a financial crisis) and partly a behavioral response to the shock of the crisis itself.

## The long shadow of financial crises

One of the most striking findings from the empirical literature is that financial crises have **permanent** or at least very long-lasting effects on the level of output. Unlike normal recessions, where GDP typically returns to its pre-recession trend within a few years, financial recessions are followed by a prolonged period during which GDP grows below trend. The result is that the level of GDP remains permanently below the path it would have followed in the absence of the crisis.

{cite:t}`RR2014` documented this pattern using data from 100 systemic banking crises. They found that the median time for real per capita GDP to return to its pre-crisis peak was 6.5 years, with a mean of 8 years. In approximately 45% of cases, the economy experienced a "double dip," meaning that GDP began to recover but then fell again before eventually returning to the pre-crisis peak.

More recent research has attempted to estimate the permanent output loss from financial crises. The estimates vary, but a common finding is that the level of GDP is 5-10% lower a decade after a financial crisis than it would have been in the absence of the crisis. The mechanisms behind this permanent loss are not fully understood, but likely include the destruction of firm-specific human capital (when firms fail, the knowledge embedded in their workforce is partly lost), the reduction in investment during the crisis (which permanently lowers the capital stock), and the hysteresis effects in labor markets (long-term unemployment erodes skills and reduces workers' attachment to the labor force).

These findings have a sobering implication for policy. If financial crises permanently reduce the level of output, then the social cost of allowing a credit boom to develop and crash is far larger than the cost of a normal business cycle fluctuation. This strengthens the case for macroprudential policies that restrain credit growth during booms, even at the cost of somewhat slower growth during the expansion. The costs of prevention are temporary (slightly lower growth during the boom), while the costs of a crisis are largely permanent (a permanently lower level of output).
