title: "3.5 Monetary Policy at the Zero Lower Bound"
subtitle: The liquidity trap and unconventional policy tools
---

In a normal recession, the central bank cuts its policy interest rate, which reduces borrowing costs, stimulates investment and consumption, and supports the recovery. This mechanism, the cornerstone of monetary policy since at least the 1990s, breaks down when the policy rate reaches zero (or close to zero). At that point, the central bank cannot cut rates further using conventional tools, and the economy may remain stuck in a prolonged slump. This problem, known as the **zero lower bound** (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, was a theoretical curiosity for most of the postwar period. It became the central challenge of monetary policy during the global financial crisis and its aftermath.

## The liquidity trap

The concept of the liquidity trap originates with Keynes, who argued in the *General Theory* that there could be situations in which increases in the money supply fail to reduce the interest rate because the public is willing to hold unlimited amounts of money at the prevailing rate. In the IS-LM framework, this corresponds to a flat LM curve: monetary expansion shifts the LM curve to the right, but the interest rate does not fall because money demand is perfectly elastic.

Paul Krugman (1998) revived the concept in the context of Japan's stagnation, reformulating the liquidity trap in modern terms ({cite:t}`Krugman1998`). In Krugman's framework, the problem is not that money demand is infinite but that the "natural" real interest rate (the rate that would equate saving and investment at full employment) is negative. If the natural rate is, say, minus 3%, and inflation is zero, the central bank would need to set the nominal interest rate at minus 3% to achieve full employment. But it cannot do so because the nominal interest rate cannot fall below zero (or, more precisely, cannot fall far below zero, since physical currency provides a zero-interest alternative to bank deposits).

The natural rate can become negative for several reasons, all of which are relevant in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Private sector deleveraging (the balance sheet recession of subsection 3.2) reduces desired investment and increases desired saving, pushing the equilibrium interest rate down. An aging population increases the supply of saving relative to the demand for investment. A decline in expected future productivity growth reduces the return on investment. Increased uncertainty about the future raises precautionary saving. All of these forces were at work in Japan after 1990 and in several advanced economies after 2008.

When the economy is at the zero lower bound and the natural rate is negative, the central bank faces a fundamental problem. It has exhausted its conventional tool (the policy rate) and the economy remains below full employment. The question becomes: what else can monetary policy do?

## Unconventional monetary policy tools

The major central banks developed several unconventional tools in response to the zero lower bound constraint. Each works through a different channel and has different strengths and limitations.

**Quantitative easing (QE)** is the purchase of long-term government bonds and other financial assets by the central bank, funded by the creation of central bank reserves. When the central bank buys long-term bonds, it increases the demand for those bonds, which pushes up their price and pushes down their yield. The reduction in long-term yields is intended to reduce borrowing costs for households and firms (who borrow at rates linked to long-term government bond yields), to stimulate asset prices (lower discount rates increase the present value of future cash flows), and to encourage portfolio rebalancing (investors who sell bonds to the central bank may reinvest in riskier assets, such as corporate bonds or equities, pushing down yields and risk premia across the financial system).

The Federal Reserve conducted three rounds of QE between 2008 and 2014, purchasing approximately $3.7 trillion of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank of England purchased approximately £375 billion of gilts. The Bank of Japan expanded its QE program dramatically under Governor Kuroda beginning in 2013, eventually owning more than 40% of outstanding Japanese government bonds. The ECB launched its Asset Purchase Programme in 2015, purchasing approximately €2.6 trillion of bonds by 2018.

The evidence on the effectiveness of QE is mixed but generally positive. Event studies (examining the market response to QE announcements) suggest that QE reduced long-term government bond yields by 50-100 basis points in the United States and by similar amounts in other countries. The effects on broader financial conditions (corporate bond yields, equity prices, exchange rates) were also significant. The effects on the real economy are harder to isolate, because QE was deployed alongside other unconventional policies and because the counterfactual (what would have happened without QE) is unobservable. Most estimates suggest that QE had a modest but meaningful positive effect on output and employment, equivalent to a conventional interest rate cut of 100-300 basis points.

**Forward guidance** is communication by the central bank about the future path of the policy rate. When the policy rate is at zero, the central bank can attempt to reduce longer-term interest rates by committing to keep the policy rate at zero for an extended period, even after economic conditions improve. If the commitment is credible, expected future short-term rates decline, which pulls down the entire yield curve. Forward guidance can also work through the expectations channel: if households and firms believe that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a long time, they may be more willing to invest and spend.

Forward guidance has evolved from vague qualitative statements ("rates will remain low for an extended period") to more specific calendar-based guidance ("rates will remain low at least through mid-2013") to state-contingent guidance ("rates will remain low at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5%"). The effectiveness of forward guidance depends critically on the credibility of the commitment. If the market believes that the central bank will raise rates as soon as economic conditions permit (regardless of its stated commitment), the effect on long-term rates will be minimal.

**Yield curve control (YCC)** is a variant in which the central bank commits to capping the yield on government bonds at a specific maturity. The Bank of Japan adopted YCC in 2016, targeting a 10-year government bond yield of approximately 0%. Under YCC, the central bank stands ready to buy whatever quantity of bonds is necessary to keep the yield at or below the target. The advantage of YCC over QE is that it specifies the price (the yield) rather than the quantity (the amount of purchases), which can be more effective at anchoring long-term rates. The disadvantage is that the commitment to buy unlimited quantities can expose the central bank to large balance sheet risks if market conditions shift.

**Negative interest rates** push the zero lower bound below zero. Several central banks (the ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Swiss National Bank, and the central banks of Sweden and Denmark) adopted negative policy rates during the 2010s, typically charging banks a small negative rate (minus 0.1% to minus 0.75%) on excess reserves held at the central bank. The rationale is to encourage banks to lend rather than hold reserves, and to reduce borrowing costs throughout the economy.

The effectiveness of negative interest rates is debated. On the positive side, negative rates appear to have reduced money market rates and short-term government bond yields in the countries that adopted them, and they contributed to the depreciation of the exchange rate (which stimulated exports). On the negative side, banks have been reluctant to pass negative rates through to retail depositors (because of the fear that depositors would withdraw cash), which limits the transmission to the broader economy. There are also concerns that very low or negative interest rates undermine bank profitability (by compressing net interest margins), which can ultimately reduce bank lending rather than increase it, a counterproductive result.

## The effectiveness debate

The academic and policy debate over unconventional monetary policy can be summarized as a disagreement about whether these tools are "real" substitutes for conventional interest rate cuts or merely "pushing on a string."

The optimistic view is that unconventional tools work through the same channels as conventional monetary policy (interest rates, asset prices, exchange rates, expectations) and can provide meaningful stimulus even at the zero lower bound. Proponents point to the event-study evidence on QE, the decline in long-term yields, the recovery of asset prices, and the eventual decline in unemployment in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries that pursued aggressive unconventional policies.

The pessimistic view is that unconventional tools are much weaker than conventional interest rate cuts, and that their apparent effectiveness is confounded by other factors (fiscal policy, the natural process of balance sheet repair, external conditions). Proponents of this view point to the very slow and incomplete recoveries in most countries despite years of unconventional policy, the failure of inflation to return to target in Japan and the Eurozone despite massive QE, and the risk that unconventional policies have side effects (inflating asset prices without generating real economic activity, increasing inequality, creating financial stability risks through reach-for-yield behavior) that may partially offset their benefits.

The balance sheet recession perspective (subsection 3.2) suggests a middle position: unconventional monetary policy can help at the margin, particularly by preventing a deflationary spiral and by supporting asset prices (which slows the deterioration of balance sheets), but it cannot by itself generate a vigorous recovery when the fundamental problem is private sector deleveraging. In this view, unconventional monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient; fiscal policy must do the heavy lifting, which is the subject of subsection 3.6.
