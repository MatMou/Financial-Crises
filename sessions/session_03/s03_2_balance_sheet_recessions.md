title: "3.2 Balance Sheet Recessions"
subtitle: When the private sector stops borrowing
---

The credit boom evidence presented in subsection 3.1 shows that financial recessions are deeper and longer than normal recessions. But the data alone do not explain the mechanism that produces such prolonged stagnation. Why do some economies remain depressed for a decade or more after a financial crisis, even when interest rates are cut to zero and monetary policy is aggressively expansionary?

Richard Koo, chief economist of the Nomura Research Institute, proposed an answer based on his close observation of the Japanese economy after the bursting of the asset price bubble in 1990. He called it a **balance sheet recession**: a recession driven not by a lack of profitable investment opportunities or by tight monetary policy, but by the private sector's collective decision to prioritize debt repayment over new borrowing and spending ({cite:t}`Koo2009`).

## The concept

In a normal recession, the private sector responds to lower interest rates by borrowing and investing more. The central bank cuts rates, borrowing becomes cheaper, investment picks up, and the economy recovers. This is the standard transmission mechanism of monetary policy, and it works well when the private sector's balance sheets are in reasonable shape.

A balance sheet recession occurs when the private sector's balance sheets are so severely damaged, typically by a collapse in asset prices, that firms and households shift from profit maximization (or utility maximization) to debt minimization. Even when interest rates are very low, firms do not borrow to invest because their priority is to repair their balance sheets by paying down debt. Households do not borrow to consume because the value of their assets (primarily housing) has fallen below the value of their liabilities, leaving them with negative equity.

The key distinction is between the behavior of individual agents and the aggregate outcome. For each individual firm or household, paying down debt is the rational response to a deteriorated balance sheet. No one can be faulted for wanting to reduce their leverage after a sharp decline in asset values. But when every firm and household simultaneously tries to pay down debt and no one is willing to borrow, the result is a collapse in aggregate demand. This is the **paradox of thrift** in its most extreme form: individually rational saving behavior produces collectively irrational stagnation.

In accounting terms, the balance sheet recession manifests as a shift in the private sector's financial balance from deficit (borrowing to invest) to surplus (saving to repay debt). When the private sector moves from net borrowing to net saving, and the shift is large enough, total spending in the economy falls by the full amount of the swing. If firms were borrowing 5% of GDP per year to invest, and they shift to saving 5% of GDP per year to repay debt, the impact on aggregate demand is a swing of 10% of GDP, which is larger than most recessions.

## Japan's Lost Decade as the canonical case

Japan provides the most thoroughly studied example of a balance sheet recession. The story begins with the asset price bubble of the late 1980s, during which Japanese stock prices roughly tripled and commercial real estate prices in major cities roughly quadrupled between 1985 and 1990. The Nikkei 225 stock index peaked at approximately 39,000 in December 1989, and commercial land prices peaked shortly thereafter.

When the bubble burst, asset prices collapsed. The Nikkei fell to approximately 14,000 by 1992, a decline of roughly 65% from the peak. Commercial real estate prices fell by 80-90% in some areas over the following decade. The destruction of wealth was enormous, estimated at approximately $15 trillion in total, or roughly three times Japan's annual GDP.

The critical consequence of the asset price collapse was the damage to corporate balance sheets. Japanese firms had borrowed heavily during the bubble, using inflated real estate values as collateral. When real estate prices collapsed, many firms found themselves "technically insolvent" in the sense that their liabilities exceeded the market value of their assets. These firms had profitable ongoing operations and could generate sufficient cash flow to service their existing debt, but they had no capacity (and no desire) to take on new debt.

According to Koo's analysis, Japanese firms responded by devoting their cash flow to debt repayment rather than to investment. Even though interest rates were cut to near zero by the Bank of Japan, corporate borrowing did not increase. Instead, the corporate sector shifted from being a net borrower (its normal state in a capitalist economy) to a net saver, running financial surpluses for more than a decade. Koo estimates that the shift from borrowing to saving by the Japanese corporate sector amounted to approximately 10% of GDP at its peak.

The consequence was a prolonged deficiency of aggregate demand. With the private sector saving rather than borrowing, and with monetary policy unable to induce new borrowing because the problem was not the cost of credit but the willingness to borrow, the only remaining source of demand was the government. This is the basis of Koo's most controversial policy recommendation: during a balance sheet recession, fiscal policy is the only effective tool, and governments should not worry about running large deficits because those deficits are simply filling the gap left by the private sector's shift to saving.

In Japan's case, the government did run large deficits throughout the 1990s and 2000s, which Koo argues prevented the economy from falling into a depression comparable to the 1930s. But the deficits were politically controversial, and periodic attempts to consolidate the budget (most notably in 1997 and 2001) were followed by renewed economic weakness, which Koo interprets as confirmation that fiscal stimulus was preventing a much worse outcome.

## The mechanism in detail

The balance sheet recession framework rests on several specific propositions about how the economy behaves when private sector balance sheets are impaired.

The first proposition is that **monetary policy becomes ineffective** when the private sector is focused on debt repayment. The central bank can lower interest rates and even create enormous quantities of reserves (as the Bank of Japan did with its quantitative easing programs), but if no one wants to borrow, the money sits in bank reserves and does not enter the real economy. This is a version of the Keynesian liquidity trap, but with a different mechanism: in the textbook liquidity trap, money demand is infinite because the interest rate is at zero; in the balance sheet recession, money demand is irrelevant because credit demand is zero.

The second proposition is that **fiscal policy is the only effective demand-side tool**. When the private sector is running a financial surplus, someone else must run a deficit to prevent aggregate demand from collapsing. In a closed economy, that someone is the government. Koo argues that during a balance sheet recession, government borrowing and spending is not "crowding out" private investment (because there is no private borrowing to crowd out) but is instead filling a demand gap that would otherwise cause output to collapse.

The third proposition is that **premature fiscal consolidation is self-defeating**. If the government attempts to reduce its deficit while the private sector is still deleveraging, the reduction in government spending or increase in taxes will reduce aggregate demand, pushing the economy back into recession. The resulting decline in tax revenue and increase in transfer payments will partially offset the intended fiscal consolidation, so the deficit may not actually decline. Japan's experience in 1997, when a consumption tax increase triggered a sharp economic downturn and ultimately worsened the fiscal position, is the standard example.

The fourth proposition is that the **duration of the balance sheet recession depends on the size of the balance sheet damage**. The larger the gap between the peak asset values (which determined the debt levels) and the post-crash asset values, the longer the private sector will need to deleverage. For Japan, where the asset price decline was enormous, the deleveraging process took approximately 15 years, from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s.

## Household balance sheet recessions

Koo's original framework focused on the corporate sector, reflecting the structure of the Japanese crisis where the bubble was concentrated in commercial real estate and corporate borrowing. The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 highlighted a different variant: the **household balance sheet recession**, in which the critical balance sheet damage occurs in the household sector.

In the United States, the pre-crisis credit boom was driven primarily by mortgage debt. Household debt rose from approximately 65% of GDP in 2000 to approximately 100% of GDP in 2007. When house prices fell by approximately 35% from their peak, millions of households found themselves with negative equity: their mortgage exceeded the value of their home. These households cut consumption sharply, partly to increase saving and partly because the collapse in housing wealth reduced their perceived permanent income.

{cite:t}`MianSufi2014` provided the most detailed empirical analysis of the household balance sheet channel during the U.S. crisis. They showed that counties with higher household debt-to-income ratios before the crisis experienced larger declines in consumption, larger increases in unemployment, and slower recoveries. The relationship was strong, consistent, and robust to a wide range of controls. They estimated that the decline in household consumption associated with the fall in housing wealth accounted for a large portion of the decline in U.S. employment during the recession.

The household balance sheet recession has some distinctive features compared to the corporate version. Household debt is more widely distributed across the population, which means that the aggregate demand effects can be very large even if the per-household debt reduction is modest. Household debt is concentrated in mortgages, which are secured against housing, a sector that is slow to adjust. And household deleveraging often involves default and foreclosure, which have additional social costs (displacement, neighborhood deterioration, loss of homeownership) beyond the purely macroeconomic effects.

## Criticisms and qualifications

The balance sheet recession framework has been criticized on several grounds.

The most common criticism is that the framework **overstates the importance of debt and understates the importance of other factors**. The prolonged stagnation in Japan, for example, was also influenced by structural factors such as an aging and shrinking population, rigid labor markets, a protected and inefficient services sector, and a banking system that was slow to recognize and write off bad loans ("zombie banking"). Attributing Japan's lost decades entirely to balance sheet dynamics, the critics argue, ignores these other important contributing factors.

A related criticism is that the framework **implies a simplistic policy prescription**. Koo's recommendation that governments should run large deficits throughout the balance sheet recession, without worrying about debt sustainability, has been contested by economists who argue that rising public debt can itself become a source of instability (as the European sovereign debt crisis demonstrated), and that the quality of government spending matters as much as the quantity. Not all fiscal stimulus is equally effective, and the returns to government spending may diminish as the deficit grows.

A third criticism is **empirical**. The balance sheet recession framework predicts that monetary policy should be ineffective during deleveraging episodes. While monetary policy was indeed slow to gain traction in Japan and in the United States after 2008, the aggressive unconventional monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and (eventually) the European Central Bank do appear to have had some positive effect on output and employment, which is difficult to reconcile with the strongest version of Koo's argument. Subsection 3.5 discusses the evidence on unconventional monetary policy effectiveness in more detail.

Despite these criticisms, the balance sheet recession framework has been enormously influential. It shifted the policy debate by highlighting the macroeconomic consequences of private sector deleveraging, by providing a coherent explanation for why monetary policy alone was insufficient to generate a vigorous recovery after the global financial crisis, and by making the case for sustained fiscal support during periods of private sector retrenchment. The framework continues to be relevant: any time a credit boom ends with a sharp decline in asset prices, the balance sheet recession dynamics described by Koo are likely to play a significant role in shaping the subsequent downturn and recovery.
