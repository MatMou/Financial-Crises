title: "3.4 The Sovereign-Bank Nexus"
subtitle: The doom loop between banking crises and sovereign debt crises
---

One of the most dangerous features of financial crises is the tendency for banking sector distress and sovereign fiscal distress to reinforce each other. Banking crises impose fiscal costs on the sovereign through bailouts, guarantees, and the automatic fiscal deterioration caused by the recession. Sovereign distress, in turn, damages the banking sector because banks hold large quantities of government debt and because the government's ability to provide a backstop diminishes. This two-way feedback loop, often called the **sovereign-bank nexus** or the **doom loop**, was at the center of the European debt crisis and remains one of the most important structural vulnerabilities of modern financial systems.

## From banking crisis to sovereign distress

Banking crises generate fiscal costs through several channels, all of which were documented in the Laeven-Valencia database discussed in subsection 1.4.

The **direct fiscal cost** arises from government interventions to rescue the banking system. These include recapitalization of banks (injecting public funds to restore bank capital), purchase of distressed assets (buying non-performing loans or toxic securities from bank balance sheets), nationalization (taking ownership of failed banks), and the provision of blanket guarantees on bank liabilities (which expose the government to contingent liabilities that may or may not be realized). The median gross fiscal outlay for systemic banking crises in the Laeven-Valencia dataset is 6.8% of GDP, but the distribution is heavily skewed: extreme cases such as Indonesia in 1997 (57% of GDP) and Ireland in 2008 (40% of GDP) are far more costly ({cite:t}`LaevenValencia2020`).

The **indirect fiscal cost** arises from the recession that accompanies the banking crisis. As output falls, tax revenues decline (corporate profits fall, incomes decline, consumption drops, and unemployment reduces payroll tax collections). At the same time, expenditures on automatic stabilizers increase (unemployment benefits, social assistance, housing support). The combination of falling revenues and rising expenditures produces a large cyclical deterioration in the fiscal balance, which is typically much larger than the direct cost of the banking sector rescue. The median increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio following a systemic banking crisis is 12.1 percentage points, but this figure understates the true fiscal impact because it does not include off-balance-sheet guarantees and contingent liabilities.

The **contingent liability channel** is especially important and often underestimated before a crisis. When the government provides guarantees on bank liabilities (whether explicit, through deposit insurance schemes, or implicit, through the expectation that the government will rescue systemically important institutions), the government's true fiscal exposure includes not only its outstanding debt but also the potential losses on those guarantees. Before the crisis, these contingent liabilities are invisible in the official fiscal accounts. When the crisis arrives and the guarantees are called, the government's debt can increase dramatically and suddenly. Ireland is the most extreme example: the government's decision in September 2008 to guarantee all liabilities of the six largest Irish banks exposed the sovereign to losses that ultimately pushed the public debt-to-GDP ratio from approximately 25% to over 120%.

## From sovereign distress to banking sector fragility

The feedback loop works in the other direction as well. When the sovereign's creditworthiness deteriorates, the banking sector suffers through three channels.

The **portfolio channel** is the most direct. Banks hold large quantities of domestic government debt, both because government bonds are treated as low-risk or risk-free assets for regulatory purposes and because banks use government bonds as collateral in interbank and central bank transactions. When the market value of government debt falls (because the probability of sovereign default or restructuring has increased), banks suffer losses on their government bond holdings. If the losses are large enough, they can erode bank capital and push banks toward insolvency. During the European debt crisis, the decline in the market value of Greek, Irish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian government bonds imposed enormous losses on the banking sectors of these countries, which in turn required further government support, completing the feedback loop.

The **guarantee channel** operates through the value of explicit and implicit government guarantees. When the sovereign's fiscal position deteriorates, the market value of the government's guarantee of bank liabilities declines. If depositors or creditors of a bank believe that the government will not be able to honor its guarantee in the event of bank failure, they have an incentive to withdraw their funds, which can trigger a bank run. The sovereign's creditworthiness is thus an input to the banking sector's stability, not just an output of it.

The **macroeconomic channel** operates indirectly. When the sovereign attempts to reduce its deficit through fiscal consolidation (spending cuts or tax increases), the resulting austerity deepens the recession, which increases loan defaults, which further damages bank balance sheets. This channel was particularly destructive during the European debt crisis, where the austerity programs imposed as conditions for bailout financing contributed to deep recessions in the program countries, which in turn worsened the banking sector's non-performing loan problems.

## The doom loop in monetary unions

The sovereign-bank nexus is especially dangerous in **monetary unions**, where countries share a common currency but retain national fiscal policies and national banking systems. In a monetary union, the central bank cannot serve as a lender of last resort to individual sovereign governments in the same way that a national central bank can, because lending to one government but not another would involve fiscal transfers between countries, which is outside the central bank's mandate.

This creates a vulnerability that does not exist in countries with their own currencies. When the U.S. or UK government faces a fiscal crisis, the Federal Reserve or Bank of England can, in principle, buy government bonds to prevent a liquidity crisis from becoming a solvency crisis. The central bank's willingness to act as a backstop anchors market expectations and prevents the kind of self-fulfilling panic in which rising yields cause fiscal deterioration, which causes yields to rise further. When a Eurozone government faces a fiscal crisis, the ECB's ability to intervene is constrained by its mandate and by political opposition from countries that would bear the risks of such intervention.

The result, as demonstrated during the European debt crisis, is that Eurozone countries are vulnerable to self-fulfilling sovereign debt crises that are similar in structure to the Diamond-Dybvig bank run model discussed in subsection 2.4. If investors believe that a government will be able to roll over its debt at reasonable interest rates, they are willing to lend at low rates, which keeps debt service costs manageable, which confirms the initial belief. If investors believe that the government may default, they demand high interest rates, which increases debt service costs, which deteriorates the fiscal position, which increases the probability of default, confirming the initial belief. The economy can shift from the good equilibrium to the bad equilibrium without any change in fundamentals, purely because of a shift in market expectations ({cite:t}`DeGrauwe2012`).

Mario Draghi's "whatever it takes" speech in July 2012, and the subsequent announcement of the ECB's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, was an attempt to eliminate the bad equilibrium by providing a credible backstop for sovereign debt markets. The OMT program was never activated, but its announcement was sufficient to collapse sovereign bond spreads in the peripheral Eurozone countries, suggesting that the self-fulfilling component of the crisis was substantial.

## Breaking the doom loop

Breaking the sovereign-bank nexus requires policies that weaken the links between banking sector distress and sovereign fiscal distress. Several approaches have been proposed and, in some cases, implemented.

**Banking union** is the most ambitious approach and was adopted in the Eurozone in response to the crisis. The key elements are: a single supervisory mechanism (the ECB supervises the largest banks in the Eurozone), a single resolution mechanism (a common authority for winding down failing banks, funded by contributions from the banking industry rather than from national taxpayers), and (in principle, though this element remains incomplete) a common deposit insurance scheme. By moving supervision and resolution to the European level, the banking union weakens the link between national banking sectors and national sovereigns.

**Reducing banks' sovereign exposure** would weaken the portfolio channel. Proposals include introducing risk weights on government bond holdings (currently, under Basel rules, domestic government bonds are treated as having zero risk weight), imposing concentration limits (caps on how much government debt a bank can hold relative to its capital), and diversification requirements (requiring banks to hold government bonds from multiple sovereigns). These proposals are technically straightforward but politically difficult, because they would raise the borrowing costs of governments that currently benefit from captive demand from their domestic banking system.

**Sovereign debt restructuring mechanisms** would address the problem from the other side by making it easier and less disruptive to restructure sovereign debt when it becomes unsustainable. The inclusion of collective action clauses in Eurozone government bonds (adopted in 2013) was a step in this direction, though the overall framework for sovereign debt restructuring in the Eurozone remains incomplete.

**Fiscal backstops and risk-sharing arrangements** would reduce the vulnerability of individual sovereigns to liquidity crises. Proposals include a Eurozone "safe asset" (a jointly issued bond that would provide all Eurozone banks with a common risk-free asset), a European deposit insurance scheme (which would break the link between national fiscal capacity and deposit insurance credibility), and a fiscal capacity for the Eurozone as a whole (a common budget that could provide transfers to countries experiencing asymmetric shocks). These proposals remain politically contentious and largely unimplemented, though the experience of the COVID-19 crisis, which led to the creation of the NextGenerationEU recovery fund financed by joint EU borrowing, suggests that some movement in this direction is possible under extreme circumstances.

The sovereign-bank nexus will recur throughout the historical case studies in this course, particularly in the discussion of the European debt crisis (Session 12). It is one of the most important structural vulnerabilities of modern financial systems, and its resolution remains one of the most important unfinished items on the post-crisis reform agenda.
