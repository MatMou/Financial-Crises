title: "3.3 Sudden Stops and Capital Flow Reversals"
subtitle: The macroeconomics of capital account crises
---

The credit boom and balance sheet mechanisms described in subsections 3.1 and 3.2 are universal: they operate in all economies that experience credit-driven asset price booms. But emerging market economies face an additional and distinctive source of vulnerability: dependence on foreign capital. When foreign capital flows in, it finances rapid credit expansion and economic growth. When it flows out, the result can be catastrophic. This subsection examines the macroeconomics of capital flow reversals, or "sudden stops," which have been the primary mechanism of financial crises in emerging markets since the early 1980s.

## The concept of a sudden stop

The term "sudden stop" was introduced by Rudiger Dornbusch and later formalized by Guillermo Calvo in a series of influential papers in the late 1990s and early 2000s ({cite:t}`Calvo1998`). A sudden stop is a sharp and unexpected reversal of capital inflows to an emerging market economy. An economy that had been receiving large inflows of foreign capital (through bank lending, portfolio investment, or foreign direct investment) suddenly finds itself unable to roll over existing debt or attract new financing. The reversal is "sudden" in the sense that it occurs over weeks or months rather than years, and "stop" in the sense that the flow of capital from abroad essentially ceases.

The macroeconomic consequences of a sudden stop are severe and mechanical. When capital stops flowing in, the current account deficit must close, because a country can only spend more than it earns (run a current account deficit) if foreigners are willing to lend it the difference. If foreigners stop lending, the current account must move toward balance or surplus. This adjustment requires a sharp contraction in domestic spending (imports must fall) and, typically, a large depreciation of the exchange rate (to make the country's exports more competitive and its imports more expensive).

The speed and magnitude of the adjustment are what make sudden stops so destructive. A country that had been running a current account deficit of 5-8% of GDP (which was common in the Asian crisis countries in the mid-1990s, and in several peripheral Eurozone countries before 2008) must close this gap within a year or two. Closing a current account deficit of this magnitude requires a contraction in domestic demand that is far larger than the deficit itself, because the decline in spending reduces output and income, which reduces imports by less than the full amount of the spending cut. The result is a deep recession, with GDP typically declining by 5-15% in a single year.

## Currency mismatches and original sin

The damage from sudden stops is amplified by currency mismatches in the balance sheets of the private and public sectors. A currency mismatch exists when an economic agent has liabilities denominated in a foreign currency (typically the U.S. dollar) but earns income in the domestic currency. This is common in emerging markets because domestic financial markets are often too small or too underdeveloped to intermediate the amounts of credit that the economy demands, forcing firms and governments to borrow abroad in foreign currency.

When the sudden stop occurs and the exchange rate depreciates, the domestic currency value of foreign-currency-denominated debt increases sharply. A firm that borrowed $100 million when the exchange rate was 10 pesos per dollar owed 1 billion pesos. If the exchange rate depreciates to 15 pesos per dollar, the same firm now owes 1.5 billion pesos, even though its revenues (earned in pesos) have not increased and may have fallen because of the recession. The increase in the real burden of foreign-currency debt is the currency mismatch equivalent of Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism: the exchange rate depreciation that is supposed to help the economy adjust actually makes the balance sheet problem worse.

{cite:t}`EichengreenHausmann1999` coined the term "original sin" to describe the inability of many emerging market countries to borrow abroad in their own currency. The label reflects the idea that the vulnerability is not the result of policy mistakes by the current government but is an inherited structural feature of the international monetary system. Countries with a history of inflation, default, or macroeconomic instability are unable to convince foreign lenders to accept the currency risk of lending in the domestic currency. As a result, they are forced to borrow in dollars, euros, or yen, which exposes them to the currency mismatch problem.

The consequences of original sin are asymmetric. When capital flows in and the exchange rate appreciates, currency mismatches are masked: the domestic currency value of foreign debt declines, balance sheets look healthy, and the economy appears to be prospering. When capital flows reverse and the exchange rate depreciates, the mismatches are revealed: the domestic currency value of foreign debt surges, balance sheets deteriorate, and the economy contracts. This asymmetry means that the boom phase is smoother and more extended than it would be without the mismatch, but the bust phase is correspondingly more violent.

## The anatomy of a sudden stop crisis

Sudden stop crises follow a recognizable pattern, though the details vary from episode to episode.

The **buildup phase** is characterized by large capital inflows, rapid credit growth, real exchange rate appreciation, current account deficits, and rising asset prices. The capital inflows are driven by some combination of domestic factors (economic reforms, deregulation, liberalization of the capital account) and external factors (low interest rates in advanced economies, search for yield by global investors, favorable commodity prices). During this phase, the economy appears to be performing well: GDP growth is strong, inflation may be contained, and asset prices are rising.

The **trigger** can be either domestic or external. External triggers include increases in U.S. interest rates (which reduce the attractiveness of emerging market assets), changes in global risk appetite, or contagion from a crisis in another emerging market. Domestic triggers include political instability, a policy reversal, or the revelation of previously hidden economic problems (such as the true extent of short-term foreign debt, which was the trigger for the Thai crisis in 1997). In many cases, the trigger is a combination of factors that interact to produce a sudden reassessment of country risk.

The **crisis phase** involves a rapid sequence of events. Capital outflows accelerate as foreign investors reduce their exposure and domestic residents move their savings abroad. The central bank faces a dilemma: it can use its foreign exchange reserves to defend the exchange rate (which delays the adjustment but depletes reserves) or allow the exchange rate to depreciate (which triggers balance sheet effects). Often, the central bank tries to defend the exchange rate for a period and then is forced to abandon the defense when reserves are exhausted, leading to an abrupt and large depreciation. Interest rates spike as the central bank attempts to attract capital and defend the currency. Credit contracts as banks face losses from exchange rate-related defaults and from the general deterioration of the economy. Output falls sharply.

The **adjustment phase** involves a painful process of current account reversal and balance sheet repair. The exchange rate depreciation makes exports more competitive, which eventually helps the current account move into surplus. But the adjustment in the short run is achieved primarily through import compression (falling domestic demand reduces imports) rather than export growth. GDP may decline by 5-15% in a single year, unemployment rises sharply, and the fiscal position deteriorates as tax revenue falls and the government assumes the costs of banking sector rescue.

## The role of exchange rate regimes

The exchange rate regime matters significantly for the dynamics of sudden stop crises. Under a **fixed exchange rate** regime, the central bank is committed to maintaining the exchange rate at a predetermined level. When capital begins to flow out, the central bank must sell foreign exchange reserves to buy domestic currency, maintaining the peg. This can work for a time, but if the outflow persists, reserves are eventually exhausted and the peg collapses. The collapse is typically abrupt, with the exchange rate overshooting its long-run equilibrium. The defense of the peg also requires very high interest rates, which deepen the recession.

Under a **flexible exchange rate** regime, the exchange rate adjusts continuously to changes in capital flows. The depreciation acts as a shock absorber, making exports more competitive and imports more expensive, which helps the economy adjust without the traumatic collapse of a fixed peg. However, the currency mismatch problem means that the depreciation is not a pure benefit: it improves the current account but worsens balance sheets.

The experience of the 1990s crises led to a consensus that hard pegs and rigidly fixed exchange rates are dangerous for emerging markets with open capital accounts. Most emerging market countries have since moved toward more flexible exchange rate regimes, typically managed floats in which the central bank intervenes to smooth excessive volatility but does not commit to a specific exchange rate level. This shift, along with the accumulation of large foreign exchange reserve buffers, has reduced the vulnerability of many emerging markets to the classic sudden stop crisis, though it has not eliminated it.

## Capital flow management and macroprudential responses

The destructive potential of sudden stops has led to a significant shift in the policy consensus regarding capital flows. The pre-1997 consensus, associated with the IMF and the "Washington Consensus," was that capital account liberalization was generally beneficial and that countries should move toward full capital mobility. The experience of the Asian crisis and subsequent episodes led to a more nuanced view.

The current mainstream position, reflected in the IMF's Institutional View on Capital Flows adopted in 2012, is that capital flows can be beneficial but also carry risks, and that capital flow management measures (sometimes called "capital controls") can be a legitimate part of the policy toolkit when other measures are insufficient. Specifically, countries may use temporary, targeted measures to limit destabilizing capital inflows during boom periods (to prevent excessive credit growth and currency appreciation) or to slow capital outflows during crisis periods (to buy time for orderly adjustment).

In practice, the most effective approach appears to be a combination of sound macroeconomic policy (avoiding large fiscal deficits and excessive credit growth), flexible exchange rates, adequate foreign exchange reserves, macroprudential regulation (limits on foreign currency borrowing, countercyclical capital buffers), and, when necessary, targeted capital flow management measures. This multi-layered approach reflects the recognition that sudden stops are caused by a combination of domestic vulnerabilities and external shocks, and that no single policy instrument is sufficient to address all of them.
