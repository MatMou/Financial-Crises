title: "1.5 Stylized Facts"
subtitle: What we know about crises in the aggregate
---

The databases described in subsection 1.4 make it possible to move beyond individual case studies and establish **empirical regularities** that hold across countries and time periods. These regularities, conventionally called "stylized facts," form the empirical backbone of the crisis literature. They are the patterns that any theory of financial crises must be able to explain, and they are the benchmarks against which policy proposals must be evaluated.

This subsection presents five stylized facts that emerge from the data. Each fact is supported by specific quantitative evidence from the Reinhart-Rogoff dataset, the Laeven-Valencia database, or both.

## Fact 1: Crises are frequent

Financial crises are not rare events. They feel rare to any individual who experiences them, because the interval between crises in a given country is typically measured in decades. But when we look across countries and time periods, the picture changes dramatically.

The Laeven-Valencia database records **151 systemic banking crises** across the globe during the period 1970-2017 ({cite:t}`LaevenValencia2020`). That is roughly 3.2 new systemic banking crises per year, somewhere in the world. If we add currency crises and sovereign debt crises to the count, the frequency is much higher. In the Reinhart-Rogoff dataset, which extends back to 1800, the total number of documented crisis episodes runs into the hundreds.

The frequency of crises is not constant over time. The BCDI composite index constructed by {cite:t}`Reinhart2009` reveals three broad phases. The pre-World War I era (roughly 1800-1914) was characterized by frequent banking crises, sovereign defaults, and currency instability, particularly during the 1820s-1840s and the 1870s-1890s. The period from roughly 1945 to 1970 was an era of relative financial calm, during which banking crises virtually disappeared in the advanced economies. This calm reflected the tight financial regulation imposed after the Great Depression (including capital controls, interest rate ceilings, and restrictions on cross-border capital flows), as well as the stability provided by the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system.

The relative calm ended in the 1970s. The breakdown of Bretton Woods, the wave of financial deregulation and liberalization that swept through both advanced and emerging economies from the late 1970s onward, and the growth of international capital markets all contributed to a sharp increase in crisis frequency. The 1980s saw the Latin American debt crisis and the U.S. Savings and Loan crisis. The 1990s brought the Nordic banking crisis, the Mexican "Tequila" crisis, the Asian financial crisis, the Russian default, and the LTCM collapse. The 2000s culminated in the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the European sovereign debt crisis.

This pattern has a clear implication: **the frequency of financial crises is not a fixed constant of nature. It is shaped by the institutional and regulatory environment.** Periods of tight regulation and restricted capital flows tend to produce fewer crises. Periods of deregulation and financial liberalization tend to produce more. This does not mean that regulation eliminates crises (the pre-war era had plenty of crises despite very different regulatory regimes), but it does suggest that the regulatory framework is a first-order determinant of crisis frequency.

## Fact 2: No country is immune

A second striking pattern in the data is the **universality** of financial crises. They are not confined to developing countries, small economies, or countries with weak institutions. The historical centers of global finance have experienced crises at rates comparable to, and sometimes exceeding, those of emerging markets.

{cite:t}`Reinhart2009` document that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have 12, 13, and 15 banking crisis episodes, respectively, since 1800. These are among the highest totals in their sample. The finding that advanced economies experience banking crises at roughly the same frequency as emerging economies was one of the most striking results of the Reinhart-Rogoff research program, and it was published just before the global financial crisis provided a dramatic real-time confirmation.

The illusion that advanced economies had "graduated" from banking crises, which was widespread before 2007, was itself an instance of the "this time is different" syndrome. In the decades following World War II, banking crises had indeed been rare in the advanced economies. But as Reinhart and Rogoff showed, this was a historical anomaly driven by the particular regulatory and institutional arrangements of the post-war period (financial repression, capital controls, Bretton Woods), not a permanent feature of advanced-economy financial systems. Once those arrangements were dismantled through deregulation and financial liberalization, advanced economies became vulnerable once again.

There is, however, an important difference in the **types** of crises experienced by advanced and emerging economies. Advanced economies have largely "graduated" from external sovereign default: no advanced economy has defaulted on its external debt since the 1950s (though Greece's 2012 restructuring came very close to breaking this record). Emerging and developing economies, by contrast, continue to experience serial default on external debt. The difference in sovereign default rates is the largest gap between advanced and emerging economies in the Reinhart-Rogoff data. For banking crises and inflation crises, the gap is much smaller.

The Laeven-Valencia data add a further nuance. While crises occur at similar frequencies across income groups, their **characteristics** differ. Crises in high-income countries tend to last longer, produce larger output losses, and involve more extensive use of blanket guarantees and expansionary macroeconomic policies. Crises in low- and middle-income countries tend to be shorter but are associated with higher direct fiscal costs (measured as government outlays on bank rescue operations as a share of GDP). These differences reflect both the greater fiscal capacity of high-income countries to sustain prolonged interventions and the different structures of their financial systems.

## Fact 3: Crises are costly

Financial crises impose large and persistent costs on the economies they affect. The costs take several forms: lost output, increased unemployment, rising public debt, and in many cases, lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.

### Output losses

{cite:t}`RR2014` examined the evolution of real per capita GDP around 100 systemic banking crises spanning from 1857 to 2013. Their findings are sobering. On average, it takes about **eight years** for per capita GDP to recover to its pre-crisis level. The median is about 6.5 years. Forty-five percent of the episodes in their sample recorded **double-dip** recessions, where an initial recovery was followed by a second decline before the pre-crisis level was eventually reached.

These recovery times are far longer than those associated with "normal" recessions. The typical post-war recession in an advanced economy lasts about one to two years, with a relatively rapid recovery. The protracted nature of post-crisis recoveries suggests that financial crises inflict structural damage on the economy that goes beyond the temporary disruption of a standard business cycle downturn. The destruction of bank capital, the impairment of the credit channel, the overhang of household and corporate debt, and the uncertainty generated by the crisis itself all contribute to a prolonged period of below-trend growth.

The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 confirmed these patterns in real time. As of 2014, five to six years after the onset of the crisis, only Germany and the United States (out of twelve countries experiencing a systemic crisis starting in 2007-2008) had recovered to their pre-crisis peaks in real per capita GDP. Countries like Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain remained far below their pre-crisis levels, with Greece having lost more than 24% of its per capita GDP.

### Fiscal costs

Systemic banking crises are also expensive for taxpayers. According to {cite:t}`LaevenValencia2020`, the median gross fiscal cost of systemic banking crises during 1970-2017 was about **6.8% of GDP** for the full sample. The median increase in public debt over the crisis period was about **12.1 percentage points of GDP**. These medians conceal enormous variation: the most expensive crises (such as Indonesia in 1997, with gross fiscal costs of approximately 57% of GDP, or Ireland in 2008, where public debt increased by more than 70 percentage points of GDP) are orders of magnitude more costly than the least expensive ones.

The fiscal costs arise from several sources. Direct bank recapitalization using public funds is the most visible component, but it is often not the largest. The indirect costs, including the loss of tax revenue during the recession, the increase in spending on unemployment benefits and social transfers, and the interest cost on the additional public debt, typically dwarf the direct costs of the bank bailout itself. This is why the increase in public debt is usually much larger than the gross fiscal cost of financial sector interventions.

### Social costs

Beyond the macroeconomic aggregates, financial crises impose severe social costs that are harder to measure but no less real. Unemployment rises sharply during banking crises and remains elevated for years. Household wealth is destroyed through the decline in house prices and equity values. Income inequality often increases, as the costs of the crisis fall disproportionately on lower-income households (who are more likely to lose their jobs and less likely to hold diversified financial portfolios), while the benefits of the recovery accrue disproportionately to owners of capital.

These social costs have political consequences. Research has shown that banking crises are associated with a rise in political polarization, an increase in support for populist and extremist parties, and a decline in trust in democratic institutions. The political aftermath of the global financial crisis, including the rise of populism in Europe and the United States, is consistent with these findings.

## Fact 4: Credit booms precede crises

One of the most robust empirical regularities in the crisis literature is that **rapid credit growth precedes banking crises**. This finding is consistent across databases, time periods, and methodologies.

{cite:t}`SchularickTaylor2012` provide the most systematic evidence. Using a new historical dataset covering 14 countries over the period 1870-2008, they demonstrate that credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises. In their logit model of crisis incidence, lagged credit growth is statistically significant and economically large: a one-standard-deviation increase in the five-year growth rate of credit relative to GDP roughly doubles the probability of a banking crisis in the following year. They summarize this finding in a phrase that has become standard in the literature: financial crises are "credit booms gone wrong."

The BIS credit-to-GDP gap provides a real-time measure of this credit-boom dynamic. The credit-to-GDP gap is defined as the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its long-run trend, estimated using a one-sided Hodrick-Prescott filter with a very high smoothing parameter ({cite:t}`Drehmann2014`). When the gap is positive and large (the BIS suggests a threshold of 10 percentage points), it signals that credit is growing much faster than its historical trend, which indicates elevated risk of a banking crisis.

The credit-to-GDP gap has performed well as an early warning indicator. In the case of the United States, the gap turned sharply positive in the early 2000s as the housing-fueled credit boom accelerated, reaching approximately 12 percentage points above trend by 2007, just before the global financial crisis. Similar patterns are visible before other major crises: the gap was elevated in Japan before the 1990 crash, in the Nordic countries before the early 1990s crisis, and in several Asian economies before the 1997 crisis.

Why do credit booms lead to crises? The mechanism connects directly to the Minsky framework discussed in subsection 1.3. During a credit boom, lending standards deteriorate, leverage increases, and an increasing share of borrowers shift from hedge to speculative to Ponzi financing positions. Asset prices rise, supported by the flow of new credit, and the rise in asset prices validates the lending decisions that fueled the boom. This circular process continues as long as credit keeps expanding. When credit growth slows, or when an adverse shock causes some borrowers to default, the mechanism goes into reverse. Asset prices fall, collateral values decline, banks tighten lending standards, and the credit contraction deepens the recession.

The regularity of this pattern is why the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted the credit-to-GDP gap as the primary guide for the activation of the **countercyclical capital buffer** under Basel III. The idea is simple: when credit is growing rapidly relative to trend, banks should be required to hold additional capital as a buffer against the losses that are likely to materialize when the boom ends.

## Fact 5: Crises cluster

Financial crises do not occur randomly across time and space. They tend to **cluster** in waves, with multiple countries experiencing crises in close succession.

The clustering of crises reflects the operation of common shocks and contagion. **Common shocks** are external factors that affect multiple countries simultaneously. The most important common shocks are changes in global interest rates (which affect the cost of borrowing for all countries), shifts in commodity prices (which affect commodity exporters and importers in opposite directions), and changes in global risk appetite (which affect capital flows to emerging markets). When the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply in the early 1980s, for example, the resulting increase in the cost of dollar-denominated debt contributed to a wave of sovereign defaults and banking crises across Latin America.

**Contagion** refers to the transmission of financial stress from one country to another through trade linkages, financial linkages, or informational channels. Trade linkages transmit stress when a crisis in one country reduces demand for the exports of its trading partners. Financial linkages transmit stress when banks in one country hold claims on institutions in another, so that losses in one banking system produce losses in another. Informational channels (sometimes called "wake-up call" effects) transmit stress when a crisis in one country causes investors to reassess the risks in other countries with similar characteristics, even if there is no direct trade or financial linkage.

The history of financial crises is organized around several major clustering episodes. The early 1980s saw a wave of banking and sovereign debt crises in Latin America, triggered in large part by the Volcker interest rate shock. The early 1990s brought banking crises to the Nordic countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden) and to Japan. The late 1990s produced a cascade of crises in East Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines), followed by Russia, Brazil, and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. The 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis affected dozens of countries simultaneously.

The clustering of crises has important implications for both theory and policy. For theory, it suggests that models of financial crises cannot focus exclusively on domestic factors. Global conditions, capital flow dynamics, and cross-border linkages are essential ingredients. For policy, it suggests that crisis prevention and management cannot be purely national: the international dimension of financial stability requires coordination among national authorities and the involvement of international institutions such as the IMF.

## Summary

These five stylized facts form the empirical foundation of the course. They tell us that financial crises are a recurrent feature of market economies (Fact 1), that no country is immune to them (Fact 2), that they impose large and persistent costs (Fact 3), that rapid credit growth is the single most reliable early warning signal (Fact 4), and that they tend to cluster in waves driven by common shocks and contagion (Fact 5). Any satisfactory theory of financial crises must account for all five of these patterns. Any effective policy framework must be designed with all five in mind.

In the next subsection, we make some of these patterns concrete by looking at real data from the Laeven-Valencia database and the BIS credit-to-GDP gap.
