Financial crises are among the most consequential events in economic history. They destroy wealth, raise unemployment, increase public debt, and can reshape political systems. And yet they keep happening. Despite advances in economic theory, financial regulation, and data availability, the world experienced a devastating global financial crisis in 2007–2009, less than a decade after the Asian crisis, and less than two decades after the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry in the United States.

This raises a question that will occupy us throughout the course: are crises an inherent feature of market economies, or are they avoidable accidents?

This introductory session sets the stage. We define what we mean by a "crisis," establish a taxonomy of crisis types, review the historical frequency of crises across time and geography, and introduce the recurring patterns that will structure the rest of the course.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this session, you should be able to:

1. Define and distinguish between economic crises and financial crises, and between the major subtypes of financial crises (banking, currency, sovereign debt, systemic).
2. Explain the Reinhart–Rogoff taxonomy and the Laeven–Valencia identification methodology, and understand why precise definitions matter for comparative analysis.
3. Describe the key stylized facts about crisis frequency, duration, and costs using real data.
4. Articulate the "this time is different" syndrome and explain why it recurs.

## Session Outline

This session is divided into the following subsections:

**1.1 Defining Economic vs. Financial Crises.** What do we mean when we say "crisis"? This subsection establishes the conceptual distinction between economic crises (declines in real activity) and financial crises (disruptions in the financial system), discusses why the distinction matters, and reviews the channels through which they interact.

**1.2 Types of Financial Crises.** A detailed treatment of the five main categories: banking crises, currency crises, sovereign debt crises, twin crises, and triple crises. For each type, we present the standard academic definition, the identification criteria used in the major databases, and a brief illustrative example.

**1.3 The "This Time Is Different" Syndrome.** The recurring pattern of boom, euphoria, and collapse that characterizes financial crises across centuries and continents.

**1.4 A Taxonomy: The Reinhart–Rogoff Framework and the Laeven–Valencia Database.** The two most important crisis databases in the literature, their scope, methodology, and limitations.

**1.5 Stylized Facts.** Five empirical regularities that emerge from the data: crises are frequent, no country is immune, crises are costly, credit booms precede crises, and crises cluster in time.

**1.6 A First Look at the Data.** Accompanying visualizations using the Laeven–Valencia crisis dates and the BIS credit-to-GDP gap.
