# Course Overview

This course examines the causes, dynamics, and consequences of economic and financial crises from the 19th century to the present. It covers the recurring patterns that generate crises, the theoretical frameworks used to understand them, and the policy responses designed to contain and prevent them.

The course combines historical case studies with analytical models and empirical evidence. It is designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in finance, economics, or related fields.

## Structure

The course is organized into five parts:

**Part I — Foundations** introduces the key definitions, taxonomies, and theoretical frameworks needed to study crises. It covers the Minsky-Kindleberger model, the financial accelerator, debt-deflation dynamics, and other foundational concepts.

**Part II — Historical Crises** walks through major crisis episodes: early speculative manias, the Great Depression, the collapse of Bretton Woods, the Latin American debt crisis, and the emerging market crises of the 1990s.

**Part III — The Global Financial Crisis** provides a detailed analysis of the 2007–2009 crisis and its aftermath, including the European sovereign debt crisis.

**Part IV — Modern Challenges** covers recent events (the COVID-19 shock, cryptocurrency crises) and forward-looking risks (climate-related financial risk, sovereign debt sustainability, AI and financial stability).

**Part V — Analytics and Policy** brings it all together with early warning systems, macroprudential regulation, crisis management tools, and a final synthesis debate.
