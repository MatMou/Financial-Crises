title: "1.1 Defining Economic vs. Financial Crises"
subtitle: What do we mean when we say "crisis"?
---

The word "crisis" is used loosely. In everyday language, it can refer to anything from a bad quarter of GDP growth to the complete collapse of a country's banking system. In academic work, we need to be more careful. This subsection establishes the conceptual distinction between economic crises and financial crises, discusses why the distinction matters for both analysis and policy, and reviews the channels through which the two interact.

## What is an economic crisis?

An **economic crisis** is a severe and sustained decline in real economic activity. The key variables are real GDP (or real GDP per capita), employment, industrial production, and trade volumes. An economic crisis is broader than a standard recession: it involves a decline that is deeper, longer, or more disruptive than what would be expected from normal business cycle fluctuations.

There is no single quantitative threshold that separates a "crisis" from a "recession." The NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, for instance, identifies recessions based on qualitative judgment about the depth, diffusion, and duration of the decline in activity, rather than applying a mechanical rule such as "two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth." In practice, the term "economic crisis" tends to be reserved for episodes where the decline in output is large (say, more than 5% peak-to-trough), the recovery is slow, and the effects on employment and living standards are widespread.

Some well-known examples of economic crises include the Great Depression of the 1930s, where U.S. real GDP fell by roughly 30% between 1929 and 1933; the deep recessions that followed the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979; and the sharp contractions experienced by several European economies after the global financial crisis of 2007–2009, with Greece losing more than 25% of its GDP between 2008 and 2013.

Economic crises can be caused by many different types of shocks. Some originate in the real economy: wars, natural disasters, pandemics, commodity price collapses, or major policy errors such as sudden trade restrictions. Others originate in the financial system, which brings us to the second concept.

## What is a financial crisis?

A **financial crisis** is a major disruption in the financial system that impairs its core functions: intermediating between savers and borrowers, providing liquidity, processing payments, and pricing risk. During a financial crisis, these functions break down, either partially or completely.

The concept is inherently about the financial system itself, not about the real economy. A financial crisis is defined by what happens to banks, credit markets, asset prices, and the payment infrastructure, not by what happens to GDP or employment. Of course, financial crises very often cause economic crises (we will discuss the channels below), but they are conceptually distinct.

{cite:t}`ClaessensKose2013` provide a useful organizing framework in their survey for the IMF. They note that a financial crisis is "often an amalgam of events" that typically includes some combination of the following: sharp declines in asset prices, failures of financial institutions, disruptions in credit markets, and large-scale government interventions. No single one of these features is necessary or sufficient on its own. What matters is that the financial system's ability to perform its basic functions is seriously impaired.

Historically, financial crises have taken many forms. In the 19th century, they often manifested as banking panics: depositors would lose confidence in one or more banks, rush to withdraw their funds, and trigger a cascade of bank failures. In the 20th century, with the development of international capital markets, currency crises and sovereign debt crises became increasingly common. In the 21st century, the global financial crisis showed that crises can originate in complex, opaque corners of the financial system (in that case, the market for mortgage-backed securities) and spread rapidly through interconnected institutions and markets.

The precise definition of a financial crisis depends on the type of crisis being studied, and the academic literature has developed separate identification criteria for banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises. We discuss these in detail in Section 1.2.

## Why does the distinction matter?

The distinction between economic crises and financial crises is not merely semantic. It matters for three reasons.

**First, causation can run in both directions.** Financial crises can cause economic crises, and economic crises can cause financial crises. But the mechanisms are different in each case, and the appropriate policy response depends on which direction the causation runs. When a banking crisis causes a recession (as in 2007–2009), the policy priority is to stabilize the financial system: recapitalize banks, guarantee deposits, restore interbank lending. When an external real shock (such as a pandemic or a commodity price collapse) causes bank losses and financial distress, the policy priority is to address the underlying shock while preventing the financial system from amplifying it.

**Second, not all recessions involve financial crises, and not all financial crises cause recessions.** The recession of 2001 in the United States, following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, was relatively mild despite a major decline in equity prices. The stock market crash of October 1987, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 22% in a single day, did not produce a recession at all. Conversely, some of the deepest and most prolonged recessions in history have been associated with banking crises, suggesting that the financial channel adds something qualitatively different to the dynamics of a downturn.

This asymmetry is one of the most important empirical findings in the crisis literature. {cite:t}`Reinhart2009` and {cite:t}`RR2014` show that recessions associated with financial crises are, on average, significantly deeper and longer than "normal" recessions. The median recovery time from a systemic banking crisis is about six to eight years, compared to roughly two years for a typical post-war recession. This finding is robust across countries and time periods.

**Third, the distinction has implications for how we measure and identify crises.** If we define a crisis purely in terms of output decline, we will miss episodes where the financial system was severely disrupted but the real economy was protected by swift policy intervention. Conversely, if we define a crisis purely in terms of financial indicators (bank failures, credit spreads, asset price declines), we may flag episodes that were contained before they caused significant real damage. The major crisis databases, such as those maintained by {cite:t}`Reinhart2009` and {cite:t}`LaevenValencia2020`, use definitions that are specific to the type of crisis (banking, currency, sovereign debt) rather than relying on a single output-based criterion.

## How do financial crises cause economic crises?

The channels through which financial crises transmit to the real economy are a central topic in macroeconomics. Understanding these channels is essential for both diagnosis and policy. The main mechanisms are the following.

**The credit channel.** When banks suffer large losses, they reduce their lending. Firms and households that depend on bank credit find it harder and more expensive to borrow. Investment and consumption fall, and the real economy contracts. This is the basic logic of the **credit crunch**, and it is the most direct transmission channel from a banking crisis to a recession.

The credit channel is amplified by the **financial accelerator** mechanism described by {cite:t}`BernankeGertlerGilchrist1999`. When asset prices fall, the value of collateral declines. Borrowers with lower collateral face tighter lending conditions (higher interest rates, lower loan-to-value ratios, shorter maturities). This forces them to cut spending, which further reduces asset prices and collateral values, creating a self-reinforcing downward spiral. The financial accelerator explains why financial crises tend to produce deeper and longer recessions than shocks of comparable magnitude that do not involve the financial system.

**The wealth channel.** Financial crises typically involve sharp declines in asset prices: equities, real estate, or both. These price declines reduce household wealth and corporate net worth. Households respond by cutting consumption (the wealth effect), and firms respond by cutting investment and employment. The magnitude of the wealth effect depends on the extent of asset ownership in the population. In countries where a large share of household wealth is held in housing (as in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain), a collapse in house prices has a particularly large impact on consumer spending.

**The uncertainty channel.** Financial crises generate a sharp increase in uncertainty about the future. When banks are failing and markets are in turmoil, firms and households do not know what the economy will look like in six months or a year. This uncertainty leads to a "wait and see" behavior: firms delay investment and hiring, and households postpone large purchases. The aggregate effect is a decline in demand that compounds the credit and wealth effects.

The uncertainty channel was particularly visible during the global financial crisis. Measures of economic policy uncertainty and financial market volatility (such as the VIX index) spiked to unprecedented levels in the fall of 2008, and survey-based measures of business confidence collapsed. Research by {cite:t}`Bloom2009` has shown that uncertainty shocks of this magnitude can, by themselves, produce significant and persistent declines in output and employment.

**The confidence and contagion channel.** Financial crises can trigger a loss of confidence that spreads beyond the institutions directly affected. When one bank fails, depositors at other banks may start to worry about the safety of their own deposits. When one country defaults, investors may reassess the creditworthiness of other countries with similar characteristics. This contagion dynamic can turn a localized problem into a systemic crisis.

The classic example is a bank run, as modeled by {cite:t}`DiamondDybvig1983`. In their framework, banks are inherently fragile because they fund illiquid long-term assets (loans) with liquid short-term liabilities (deposits). If enough depositors try to withdraw simultaneously, the bank is forced to liquidate assets at a loss and may fail, even if it was fundamentally solvent. The fear of failure becomes self-fulfilling. Diamond and Dybvig's model shows that bank runs are a coordination failure: each depositor's individually rational decision to withdraw creates a collectively irrational outcome.

## How do economic crises cause financial crises?

The reverse channel is also important. A severe recession in the real economy can destabilize the financial system through several mechanisms.

**Rising defaults.** When output falls and unemployment rises, borrowers (households and firms) become less able to service their debts. Non-performing loans increase, bank capital erodes, and if the losses are large enough, banks become insolvent. This is what happened in many countries during the Great Depression: the economic contraction caused a wave of farm and business failures, which in turn caused a wave of bank failures.

**Fiscal deterioration and the sovereign-bank nexus.** A deep recession reduces government tax revenue and increases government spending on unemployment benefits, social transfers, and (often) bank bailouts. If the resulting increase in public debt raises concerns about sovereign creditworthiness, the government's borrowing costs increase. Banks that hold large amounts of government debt suffer capital losses, which weakens them further and may force them to cut lending. This creates a **doom loop** between sovereign risk and banking risk, a dynamic that was central to the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–2012.

**Asset price declines.** A severe recession depresses corporate earnings, reduces the value of real estate, and lowers equity prices. These asset price declines reduce the value of collateral held by banks and erode bank capital, potentially triggering a banking crisis even if the financial system was sound before the recession began.

## The feedback loop

In practice, the most severe crises involve a feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy. A financial shock causes a credit crunch, which causes a recession, which causes more bank losses, which deepens the credit crunch, and so on. This two-way interaction is what makes financial crises so much more damaging than ordinary recessions.

{cite:t}`Fisher1933` was among the first to describe this feedback loop in his theory of **debt-deflation**. Fisher argued that when the price level falls, the real burden of debt increases (because debts are fixed in nominal terms). Debtors cut spending to service their debts, which reduces demand and puts further downward pressure on prices. This creates a vicious circle of falling prices, rising real debt burdens, and declining output. Fisher developed this theory in the context of the Great Depression, but the basic logic applies whenever a financial shock interacts with deflation or disinflation.

More recently, {cite:t}`Koo2009` introduced the concept of a **balance sheet recession** to describe the Japanese experience after the collapse of the asset bubble in 1990. Koo argued that when asset prices fall sharply, firms and households find themselves with negative equity (their debts exceed the value of their assets). Their priority shifts from profit maximization to debt repayment. Even at very low interest rates, they refuse to borrow. This creates a persistent shortfall in aggregate demand that conventional monetary policy cannot fix, because the problem is not the cost of credit but the unwillingness of damaged balance sheets to take on new debt.

The concepts of debt-deflation and balance sheet recession will reappear throughout this course. They are essential for understanding why recovery from financial crises is typically so slow, and why the policy toolkit needs to go beyond standard interest rate cuts.

## A note on terminology

Throughout this course, we use the terms "financial crisis" and "economic crisis" with the specific meanings defined above. When we refer to a specific type of crisis (banking, currency, sovereign debt), we will use the more precise term. When we refer to a crisis that involves both financial disruption and a severe economic downturn, we will typically say "financial crisis" or "systemic crisis," since financial crises are almost always the more analytically interesting and policy-relevant category.

The term **systemic crisis** deserves special attention. A crisis is "systemic" when it affects the financial system as a whole, rather than just a single institution or market. The failure of a small bank is a financial event but not a systemic crisis. The failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, which triggered a freeze in global interbank markets and a cascade of losses across the financial system, was a systemic crisis. The distinction matters because systemic crises typically require system-wide policy interventions (such as blanket guarantees, central bank lending facilities, or government recapitalization programs), whereas isolated failures can be handled through normal resolution procedures.
